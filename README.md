# 50.001-info-sys

Shibushi (试不试) is a virtual wardrobe app designed to help you organise your wardrobe, plan your fits and share them with a like-minded community! This app was submitted for the 1D project during the 50.001 Information Systems & Programming course in SUTD, Spring 2022.  


## Features

## Design and Structure

### Cloud Data Structure
We used two databases from Firebase - **Cloud Storage** and **Cloud Firestore**. The reason was that Cloud Storage was better suited for image storage with higher storage capacity and could natively handle JPEG and PNG images. Clothing metadata was stored on Cloud Firestore due to more comprehensive queries, and to consolidate with user and outfits metadata.  

For Cloud Firestore, we have 3 collections: **cUsers**, **cClothes** and **cOutfits** which holds the metadata for a user, clothing and outfit respectively. All images are stored under the images folder in Firebase Storage.  

#### cClothes
Each clothing is stored as a document containing its metadata such as _colour_, _category_, _size_ and _occasion_. The field “userid'' helps us identify the owner of that clothing. _Creation time_ as a timestamp object for tracking purposes, and most importantly the _img_name_ which is used as a reference to the image of the clothing stored in cloud storage.  

#### cOutfits
Each outfit is stored as a document containing its _name_, _userid_ of the owner, _timestamp_ of its creation time, unique _outfitID_ which is used to reference the outfit document, and _category_. For fast referencing to the images in cloud storage, we also stored an _img_names_ array containing the image names of all clothing in a single outfit. Furthermore, under _item_ is an array of all the clothing documents that are part of the outfit which could be used for outfit classifications.  

#### cUsers
We keep track of attributes related to the community feed. The field _bio_ contains user’s bio, an array of _followers_ containing the userid of all the user’s followers, another array of _following_ containing all the userid that the user is following, _userid_ as a reference to the current document, and _username_ of the user. The user’s _profile_photo_ also stores the reference to the image of the user’s profile photo in cloud storage.  

### Models

**cWardrobe**, **cClothing**, **cUsers** and **cOutfits** are model classes that correspond to the collections in the firestore. These models were used to store data in local variables temporarily for easy referencing, so that we do not need to do multiple queries to fetch them from the Firestore.

## Concept Highlights

### Comparable Interface
To sort outfits in feed in descending timestamp, the Comparable interface was implemented under the model class cOutfits.

### Nested RecyclerView
On top of the recyclerView taught, we modified it and implemented a nested recyclerview to suit the needs of our application. The feed and profile consists of a parent recyclerview, populated by the user's outfits. Inside each outfit is a child recyclerview populated by images belonging to that outfit. Thus, to do this we created FeedParentAdapter and Feed Child Adapter classes.  

In FeedActvitiy, a query is made to fetch the most recent outfits created by current user’s list of following users, and stored to cOutfitsArrayList. It is then passed to FeedParentAdapter, which will then pass a list of the clothing’s image names into FeedChildAdapter.  

### Nested Interface in an Adapter Class
cUsersAdapter is an adapter class used to populate the RecyclerView in SearchActivity. It makes use of a nested interface called UserClickListener, that requires us to define the method onSelectedUser under SearchActivity. An example is shown in the code below. When users select any of the Users displayed in the recyclerview in SearchActivity, it will start an activity of the selected user’s profile.

### Executor and ExecutorService
Since processing and loading photos takes time, we added ExecutorService to load the bitmaps inside the recyclerView in outfits and wardrobe features. The code snippet below shows how Picasso library was used in the background single thread to load and resize images. This modification improves the user experience as it significantly reduces the time taken to load bitmaps onto the imageviews.
